# config-migration

This tool is my take on dotfiles management.

## Motivation
As you work with multiple machines and sometimes on vms you need to debug you find 
the environment lacking of the configurations you made on your own system. You want your
configurations because they boost your workflow but either your need to integrate your full
dotfiles repository that maybe does some things different or much more stuff than you need
or copy some configurations manually.

## Goals
Config-migration should:
* help to version control your dotfiles
* help to migrate your dotfiles on a new system
